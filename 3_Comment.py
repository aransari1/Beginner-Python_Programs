###################### Python Comments ######################

# Information: Comments in Python is used to insert information related to the code or the program's working. For the other person to read and understand the code properly.


# Note: Comments are not executed during the code execution, so please don't insert any code you want to execute in the comment's line.

# Example: This code will not be executed during the Execution phase --> print ("This string is not executed during the execution")


# To use the single line comment in Python, we need to use (# symbol) before the comment. anything written in the right side of the # will be treated as the comment.

# Single line comment example:

# This is the example of single line comment. You can not use comment in the next line without using the # symbol, else it will show you an error.

''' To use multi-line comment, you need to surround the text with triple (single/double quotes)
which will be applicable until you insert the triple (single/double quotes) in the end.'''

# Multi-line comment example:

"""
This is 
the example
of double quotes
multi-line
comment."""

'''
This is
the example
of single quotes
multi-line
comment.
