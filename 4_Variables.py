###################### Variables in Python ######################

# Variables in python are used to store data. it works as a temporary memory to store the data.

# Lets learn about the variables using the example.

Lets suppose you have many types of foods. some are big, some are small, some are solid, some are liquid, some are hot, some are cool, .
You can not put the big food in the small container(box).
You can't put the small food in the bigger box as it will waste remaining space in the box.
You can't put the liquid food in the box with holes or in paper box.
You can't put the hot food in the plastic box or any box which has melting property.
You can't put the cool food in the paper box or any box which can be damaged with the cold temperature.

# Same Python has the types of variables to store different types of data (food in example).

Variable = "variable can store any types of Data. But one type of data at once"
